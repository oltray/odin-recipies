                <h3> How to Make pancakes Step-by-Step:</h3>
                <p>

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li1>
                        Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                    </li1>
                    <li2>
                        Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.
                    </li2>
                    <li3>
                        Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.
                    </li3>
                    <li4>
                        Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.
                    </li4>
                    <li5>
                        Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel. (You want just a bit of a sheen; don’t overgrease the griddle.) Spoon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes.
                    </li5>
                    <li6>
                        Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings.
