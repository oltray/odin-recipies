        <ol>
            <li1>
                Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin cups with cooking spray. 
            </li1>
            <li2>
                Wrap hash browns in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible. Stir together hash browns, melted butter, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Press about 1/4 cup of the hash brown mixture into bottom and up the sides of each prepared muffin cup. 
            </li2>
            <li3>
                Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes.      
            </li3>
            <li4>
                Meanwhile, stir together cheese, eggs, bell pepper, and crushed red pepper (if using) in a bowl.      
            </li4>
            <li5>
                Remove muffin tin from the oven. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Top hash browns with half of the bacon. Top with egg mixture and remaining bacon. Bake until a knife inserted into centers comes out clean, 13 to 15 minutes. Garnish with chives.
